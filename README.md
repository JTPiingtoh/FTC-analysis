Used to semi_automate the analysis of femoral trochlear cartilage ultrasound images. Typically measurements are taken using ImageJ/Fiji. To streamline this process, a directory containing .tiff files can be supplied, with a region of interest being highlighted using ImageJ's polygon tool.
Common measurements can then be taken from these images, including thickness, cross sectional area, and echo intensity, which are then automatically saved to an excel spreadsheet.
